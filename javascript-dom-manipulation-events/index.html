/* Write a JavaScript code that implements below:
• Add paragraph element to body with text “The Document Object Model (DOM) is a
programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the page so that
programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents
the document as nodes and objects. That way, programming languages can connect to
the page.”
• Set the paragraph text color to purple
• Add another paragraph to body with text” A Web page is a document. This document
can be either displayed in the browser window or as the HTML source. But it is the same
document in both cases. The Document Object Model (DOM) represents that same
document so it can be manipulated. The DOM is an object-oriented representation of
the web page, which can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript.”
• Set another paragraph text color to red
• Set the body color to light grey
